This is a Google search result clone.

#Header

In this first section I included the google logo image, an input field of type text as the search bar and two other images for more apps and the person that is currently logged in to the google account.

I floated left the google logo image, and floated right the two other images
Under the search bar I positioned the nav tag with a few <a> tags and a <button> tag
To space the elements between each other I used padding and to adjust their position I used positon:relative
